. Final Test and Completion


In your `view-posts.ejs` file, you're passing the `postId` as a query parameter in the URL when the Edit button is clicked. However, in your Express route `/edit-posts`, you're trying to access it from `req.body`, which is incorrect. Query parameters are accessed from `req.query`. Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
app.get("/edit-posts", (req, res) => { 
  const { postId } = req.query;
  const index = blogPosts.findIndex(post => post.postId === postId);
  console.log("open post " + postId);

  if (index !== -1) {
    res.render("edit-posts.ejs", { blogPost: blogPosts[index] }); // Pass a single post object
  } else {
    res.send("Post not found");
  }
});
```

Make sure to also adjust your `edit-posts.ejs` file to handle the `blogPost` object instead of `blogPosts`.

Additionally, it seems you're using `req.body` to retrieve query parameters. However, query parameters are sent in the URL and are accessed via `req.query`. `req.body` is used to access parameters sent in the request body, typically used in POST requests.
